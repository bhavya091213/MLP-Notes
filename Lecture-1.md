## What is machine learning?
- Modification
- Experience
- Memorization and generalizations
- Change in mind and physucal state or a positive/useful change measured by a proper metric
- Through repetitive trials,f ollowing instrucitons and practices

## Example
You build an arch but you didn't know that you built an Arch until you are told

Going deeper, push a toy car through the arch
Hand gets trapped so need to do the "hand change" phenomenon

TO even create an Arch and to define one, need to addd descriptions to define it
- Two standing blocks and a lying block
- The standing blocks cant touch
- The standing blocks must support the lying block


What if the top block's shape change? Produces a *hand change* 
We can recognize the various types of block-arches, "hand-change" occurs and creates teh criterion to generalize an arch

Important to have a right learning metirc, but enough examples as well


## Machine learning
A machine learns the way to perform a task
- classification
- object detection, etc

### Heauristic programming
- finding a practical solution rather than targeting the exact and theoretical frameworks (learning a function)

### Automatic learning
- FUnctional models are to be updated based on observations (past data) and performance metric
- It is impossible to program the process of human recognition as there is no direct instructional programming involved

### Disadvanteges
- generalizations and false positives
- overfitting
- heuristic functions lack interpritability


Generalization is the primaru challenge for ML, different models yeild different results

## Prnciples
Functions: *model*
Experience: *data*
Metric: *loss*
Change: *training/updating parameters*

Things lime biased data and loose loss metrics deteriorate the model, need to be aware


- Why not just puruse complex model?
  - Need to be cognizant of how many data points



## Two poles: Heuristic vs. Symbolic Approach

### Connectionism
- Heuristic Approach
  - learning a function
  - data driven
  - focus on end-effect
  - make it work
  - inductive
  - ML classifies as this

### Symbolic AI / Uses General Knowledge
- Rule based/classic
  - Focus on the representation of true knowledge
  - Serial and logical processing of symbolic expression to drive new knowledge
  - no data, no function
  - deductive

## Heuristic approaches
- Make a machine to *Search*
  - how to effectively tyest all possible solutions and find an optimal?
- Make a machine do *Pattern Recognition*
  - what patterns and features would be useful for AI problem
- Make a machine to do *Learning* from past and predict future
  - how can we find a model to generalize the experience from past so enable to predict future?
